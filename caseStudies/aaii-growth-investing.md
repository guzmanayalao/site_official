goal: "Design and develop a new product for AAII. AAII has tens of thousands of
  members, and hundreds of thousands of users. The product will serve as a
  dynamic template for finance/investing beginners and experts. "
how: We start by having a conversation about specs. What needs to displayed to
  users, what is most important, what are the goals the company has for users,
  etc. The basic idea is we want to know what they are looking for so we can
  creatively solve their problem. We start by designing user personas that
  emulate what an actual user would be like. By putting ourselves in users'
  shoes, along with implementing company specs, we can begin designing. Next, we
  begin making very simple wireframes with out colors and text, and gradually
  work our way to a higher fidelity web design like the one you see here. After
  some rounds of iteration and changes, we arrive at a point where both the
  designer and company are happy. Below you will see a preview of what we ended
  up designing for them!
