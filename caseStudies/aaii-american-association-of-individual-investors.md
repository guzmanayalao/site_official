tldr: As a principal member of AAII's tech team, we were tasked with developing
  the front end of their website redesign.
goal: Redesign and rebuild AAII's website.
how: The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) needed a fresh look
  for their website. We had to make sure that the design encompassed and
  communicated their services as an educational resource for investors. We were
  able to highlight their stock/ticker information, robust journal and article
  posts, featured writers, featured community, and featured videos. The site is
  fully responsive and works on any device.
