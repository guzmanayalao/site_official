tldr: Dedicated Runners are a logistics company from the Southwest side of Chicago.
goal: Design and build a logistics company's website from scratch in 2 days.
how: Dedicated Runners are a logistics company from Chicago, IL. We were tasked
  with designing and developing a full website in 2 days. We went to work and
  began researching logistics companies and began to learn how they exist
  online. We took notice of different website features, but mainly their
  offering of a broad range of services and a job application section. We also
  implemented a beautiful set of professional stock photos which we offer to our
  clients at no cost.
