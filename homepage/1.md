  Benji is an imaginative 17 year old artist from Little Village, Chicago. He's
  inspired by Gherbo's realness, Kid Cudi's cosmic themes, and Lil Peep's
  defiance. After dropping out of high school to pursue his dreams, Benji has
  played with Chicago's hip hop boundaries with songs like "Menace", "Monster",
  and "WarZone". Chicago has listened and it wants more.
